<h4>
  <b>General Commands</b>
</h4>
`Ctrl+A` __:__ Go to the beginning of the line

`Ctrl+E` **:** Go to the end of the line

`Ctrl+U` **:** Deletes everything on a line before the cursor

`Ctrl+K` **:** Deletes everything on a line after the cursor

`Ctrl+R` **:** Recursive search

`![command]` **:** Returns the last command which begins with the placeholder

`>` **:** Write to file

`> >` **:** Append to file

`head/tail` **:** Show beginning or end of file

`wc` **:** lines words bytes

`ps aux` **:** List processes

`kill -15 [pid]` **:** Kill the process with id 'pid'

`pwd` **:** Print working directory (Current path)

`cd -` **:** Changes to previous directory

`&&` **:** Runs next command only if the previous one succeeded

`;` **:** Colon runs next command regardless of whether the previous one succeeded

`grep -ri` **:** grep (search) recursively, case-insensitive

`ln` **:** Link files (same file, different location)

<br />

<h4>
  <b>Less</b>
</h4>
`Ctrl+F` or `[spacebar]` __:__ move forward a page

`Ctrl+B` **:** Move back a page

`[Arrow keys]` **:** Move by line

`/[search term]` **:** Find in file. Use ’n’ to go to cycle through found instances

`G` / `1G` **:** Go to end/beginning of a file

<br />

<h4>
  <b>Ag</b>
</h4>
`-Q` __:__ Gets rid regex default

`-l` **:** Only shows filename (Not line and line number)

`-i` **:** Case insensitive search

`-G` **:** Define filename/path name to search within

`--ignore-dir=railties/lib` or `--ignore-dir=“*.rb”` **:** Exclude directories/file patterns from a search

`--skip-vcs-ignores` **:** Returns results for files in .gitignore

<br />

<h4>
  <b>cURL</b>
</h4>
`-i` __:__ Return headers

`-o` **:** Download file

`-X` **:** Specify HTTP request type(GET, POST, PUT), passed as an argument

`-d` **:** Adds params in quotations to request body. Can be specified as json, even from a file (using @[json_file_name].json)

`-F` **:** Mimic form data

`-H` **:** Define headers e.g “Accept: application/json”

`-u` **:** HTTP authentication (pass “username:password”)

`-D` / `-b` **:** Save returned cookies to file / Pass saved cookies file to server.

`-c` **:** Can be used to store just the cookies (unlike -D where headers are also stored)

<br />

<h4>
  <b>find</b>
</h4>
`find [PATH_TO_SEARCH] [OPTIONS_TO_USE] [PATTERN_TO_SEARCH_FOR]`

- Place `\` before pattern wildcards(`.`,`*`) e.g `*` => `\*`

`-name` **:** File names

`-path` **:** Path name

`-type` **:** `f` for file, `d` for directory

`-or` **:** replaces implicit ‘AND’ searching with ‘OR’ searching. Use parenthesis (backslashed) to control

`-not` or `\!` **:** Not matching query

`-mtime` and `-mmin` **:** Modified in the last `n` days or minutes (make sure numbers are negative)

`-size` **:** Size greater than value in bytes. `k`, `M` and `G` can be substituted for kilo, mega and giga. Include `+` before number.

`-print -delete` **:** Prints and deletes matching files. Usually appended to end of query

<br />

<h4>
  <b>grep</b>
</h4>
`grep [flags] [term] [filename and extension]` - regex by default, accepts multiple
filenames

`-c` **:** Counts instances

`-n` **:** Shows line numbers

`-i` **:** case insensitive

`-R` **:** Recursive search through directories

`—include = “[pattern]”` **:** Only searches files that match this pattern

`-v` **:** Invert search

<br />

<h4>
  <b>ps</b>
</h4>
`PID` __:__ Process ID

`TIY` **:** Controlling terminal

`TIME` **:** Cumulative CPU time used by process since starting

`CMD` **:** Name of running command

`u` **:** Extra info columns

`-e` **:** All processes

`-U` **:** Get processes being run by a user e.g root

`-O` **:** provide specific columns to show

`-m` **:** Sort by memory

`-r` **:** sort by CPU usage

<br />

<h4>
  <b>sed</b>
</h4>

`sed “[pattern] / s / [regex search] / [replacement] / [manipulation] / [flags] ” [source file]`

- Executes on each line in the source file

- **flags (optional) :** `g` (global replace), `2` (second instance), `i` case insensitive, `p` (prints only modified content to the console), `w` (only writes modified content)

- **pattern (optional) :** Only matches/manipulates lines which match this pattern

- **manipulation (optional) :** `\u` (converts whatever comes after it to uppercase),
  `&` (represents to regex search),
  `\l` (lowercase)

`sed “ / [regex search] / d ”` **:** delete matching line (does not alter file, only STDOUT)

`-i` **:** Edit file in place (rather than sending output to STDOUT)
adding `.tmp` saves second file with files original content
`-n` **:** Suppress output

<br />

<h4>
  <b>sed</b> (Archiving)
</h4>

`tar -c [files/directories]` (Can be multiple files/dirs, separated by a space)

`-c` **:** create a new archive (Written to STDOUT)

`-f` **:** Save to file. File must be passed as first parameter e.g foo.tar

`-v` **:** Outputs archived files after creation

`-t` **:** Print archived files

`-r` **:** append files to an archive (not compatible with compressed archives)

`-u` **:** Update file already in tar file (not compatible with compressed archives)

`-x` **:** Extract files from archive

`-C [folder name]` **:** State where the archive is to be extracted to

`-z` **:** Compress archive. Convention: Add “.gz” to tar file name e.g foo.tar.gz

`-z` **:** Uncompress archive

`-T` **:** Read files/dirs from file

`-` **:** Means the -T file is to be the piped in input

<br />

<h4>
  <b>Other Commands</b>
</h4>
`cal` (defaults to showing one month)

<br />

`cat`

- `[No arguments]` **:** Prints out contents or argument file

- `[file 1] [file 2]` **:** Concatenates the two files

<br />

`kill [process ID]` **:** Peacefully shutdown when ready (despite command name)

- `-s SIGKILL` **:** Forcefully kill a process

<br />

`tail [file name]` **:** Prints out last 10 lines

- `-n [number]` **:** Prints out any amount of lines, starting from the end

<br />

`tree` **:** Recursively lists directories and files. Can optionally pass directory (defaults to current directory)

- `-L [number]` **:** Defines number of recursive levels
