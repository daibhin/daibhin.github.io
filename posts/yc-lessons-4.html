<!-- --><p><strong>Don’t do yourself out of a customer.</strong> The right customer for your product is hard to come by and even harder to retain. You should never be the one breaking up with them. Your cost of winning them back is much higher. Make sure your product doesn’t put your customer in a place where they no longer need you. Similarly, make sure your product doesn’t make your customers feel bad or guilty.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p><strong>Be a revenue generator.</strong> Not a cost saver. People or companies purchasing your product have 100 other things they could be spending their money on. You should rightly have to justify why yours is worth the cost. It’s much easier to convince someone if they already feel an acute pain or understand that you can make their lives 10x faster/easier. Be a pain killer not a vitamin.<!-- --></p></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/posts/yc-lessons-4","query":{},"buildId":"5XjfA1Y6gVshClxRW5E3Q","assetPrefix":"/personal-site","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
