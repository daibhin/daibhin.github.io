<!-- --><p><strong>Value first, scale later</strong>. Think about how you can provide value as early as possible - don’t take steps in the right direction. Your target is probably wrong, or will certainly change before you get there so try and get as close as possible first and course correct from there.
Route around the unscalable to fake the end goal. You first need to prove that the end goal is valuable, that’s paramount. How you get there is a mere formality in your customers eyes. They will judge you based on value offered not effort undertaken. Use the luxury of dedicated founders and not very many customers to cheat/hack your way to value quickly.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p><strong>Think about revenue from the off</strong>. This is a business. Losing money is very different from having no path to revenue. The Facebooks of the world are rare. You’re more likely to survive by charging from the start.<!-- --></p></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/posts/yc-lessons-1","query":{},"buildId":"5XjfA1Y6gVshClxRW5E3Q","assetPrefix":"/personal-site","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
