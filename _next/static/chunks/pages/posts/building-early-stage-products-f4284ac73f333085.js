Some features are easier to bundle together (e.g. when they span multiple codebases) and thus should not be shipped until the entire feature is ready. Other features are relatively low risk and should be shared asap. I'd personally opt for shipping everything in small chunks where possible. The cognitive overhead of multiple unshipped pieces of work can lead to a large number of bugs.
