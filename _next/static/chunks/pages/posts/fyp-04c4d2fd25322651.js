This is probably best gauged by going to meet with lecturers individually before you have to make your choice, even before college starts back. Meeting with lecturers is one of the most insightful things I found when choosing a project, they've been through the process enough times.

Some of these are included for people who simply want to pass. If you're willing to put the effort into a harder project you will likely get higher marks. Given you're completing the project in an academic environment there will be a preference towards theoretical projects. In Computer Science this meant choosing a research project (e.g. machine learning or algorithm based) over building a mobile or web app. Research projects tend to be more open, with no definitive goal. It's probably worth acknowledging this style of work given it's more akin to the real world. After you're finished your degree, you won't be handed assignments to complete.
